The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary are:

1. `BybitAPI`: This class will handle all interactions with the Bybit API. It will have methods for getting the current market price, placing orders, and getting the account balance.

2. `MACDIndicator`: This class will calculate the MACD indicator based on the price data. It will have a method `calculate` that will return the MACD line and the signal line.

3. `TradingBot`: This class will use the `BybitAPI` and `MACDIndicator` to make trading decisions. It will have a method `run` that will start the trading loop, and a method `trade` that will execute trades based on the MACD signals.

4. `main`: This function will be the entry point of the program. It will create an instance of the `TradingBot` and start it.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.
